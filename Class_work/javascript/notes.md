map() creates a new array by applying a function to each element. - modify data
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const doubled = numbers.map(num => num \* 2);
console.log(doubled);
// [2, 4, 6, 8]

filter() creates a new array with elements that pass a condition. - remove unwanted data
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const evens = numbers.filter(num => num % 2 === 0);
console.log(evens);
// [2, 4]

reduce() reduces the array to a single value (number, object, string, etc.).
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const sum = numbers.reduce((acc, num) => acc + num, 0);
console.log(sum);
// 10

for...of is used to iterate over values of iterable objects (arrays, strings, maps, sets, etc.)
const arr = [10, 20, 30];
for (const value of arr) {
console.log(value);
}
// 10, 20, 30

for...in is used to iterate over keys (property names) of an object.
const arr = [10, 20, 30];
for (const index in arr) {
console.log(index);
}
// "0", "1", "2"

const user = { name: "Amit", age: 25 };
